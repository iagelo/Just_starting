## 502 Bad Gateway Error

The quick fix is to run the following:

```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1024 count=1024k
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
```

Your swapfile is now running and active, but to set it so that it's activated on each boot we need to edit /etc/fstab:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

Paste the following onto the bottom of the file:

```bash
/swapfile       none    swap    sw      0       0 
```

Now restart your VPS:

```bash
sudo restart
```

Wait a minute or two for your VPS to reboot, and then try GitLab again. If it doesn't work the first time, refresh the Bad Gateway page a couple of times, and you should soon see the GitLab login page.
